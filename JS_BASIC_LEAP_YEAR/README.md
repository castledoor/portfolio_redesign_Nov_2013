<p>How to calculate a leap year?</p>

<p>Is it divisible by 4? then its a leap year<p>

<p>unless it's also divisible by 100, then its not a leap year</p>

<p>UNLESS that year is also divisible by 400</p>

<p>then you have a leap year</p>


<p>confused?  No problem I did the math for you here: http://thenextepicode.3owl.com/LEAP_YEAR/index.html</p>


<p>Check to see if this year is a leap year</p>
